# NBA Hackathon

There were two questions that were asked for the 2017 NBA Hackathon:

The first question asked to determine the probability that a team who always has a 80% chance to win never loses back to back games during an 82 game season. I found the answer of this question to be 5.88%, the answer was calculated four different ways:
• Dynamic programming, to get the answer deterministically
• An approximation using a derived formula
• An approximation using large scale simulation
• A clever use of pascal's triangles to find the exact probability

The second question asked to find the exact date that each team was mathematically eliminated from playoff contention using the previous season's regular season results and all playoff tie breaking procedures. Using an object oriented approach, I was able to get the correct results.
